  ## Description
  This project is designed to help developers expedite the process of creating a README file for their web applications. Instead of having to use the markdown notation in the creation of their README, this nodeJS program will take in text and checkbox input from the user and create a formatted document complete with page links to the different sections of the file (for those extra extensive projects out there).
  ## Installation
  The process to install this application is as simple as cloning the GitHub repository to your computer and using 
  
    npm init -y
  and 
  
    npm install inquirer 
  through npm once you have navigated to the correct directory (README-generator) on your terminal.
  ## Usage
  The program will run on the CLI, so usage is fairly barebones. The application is started by navigating to the applications directory and opening the integrated terminal within VS Code or just using your computer's native terminal/CLI. After this, you must type 
  
    node index.js
  into the command line to initialize the application within your terminal/CLI. After this, it is as simple as typing in the responses to each prompt (or selecting a license using the arrow keys and spacebar) followed by the enter/return key to confirm the input.
  ## Contribution
  If you would like to contribute, please email me at markbarstowjr@gmail.com, although I'm not sure why you'd wanna contribute to such a simple thing. This section is included strictly to display the functionality of my application.
  ## Testing
  No testing functionality included.
